# Smart AI-Based Traffic Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a **Smart AI-Based Traffic Management System** designed to optimize traffic flow at intersections with heavy traffic from multiple directions. It uses **reinforcement learning (Deep Q-Learning)** to dynamically adapt traffic light timings based on simulated traffic conditions. A **Flask-based backend** is used for managing the simulation and providing real-time updates of traffic metrics.

## Features
- **Adaptive Traffic Signal Control:** AI agent adjusts traffic light timings dynamically based on traffic flow in simulation.  
- **Reinforcement Learning (DQN):** Learns optimal signal timing strategies through trial-and-error in a simulated environment.  
- **Simulation Integration:** Works with traffic simulations to test and evaluate traffic management strategies.  
- **Flask Backend:** Provides real-time simulation updates and traffic metrics.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates traffic flow efficiency, average waiting time, and congestion reduction.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Web Framework:** Flask (Backend for simulation control and real-time updates)  
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow / PyTorch for reinforcement learning (DQN)  
- **Simulation Tools:** SUMO or other traffic simulation frameworks  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
